### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on fun projects, mostly involving maths or minecraft.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: When I was seven, the first piece of real code I wrote was an implementation of the Fibonacci Sequence.
- ðŸ“š I'm a student at a German grammar school ("Gymnasium") and particularly enjoy mathematics and CS.
